## question
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return true if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and false otherwise.

## solution

```
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(flowerbed)):
            # Check if the current plot is empty.
            if flowerbed[i] == 0:
                # Check if the left and right plots are empty.
                empty_left_plot = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0)
                empty_right_lot = (i == len(flowerbed) - 1) or (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)
                
                # If both plots are empty, we can plant a flower here.
                if empty_left_plot and empty_right_lot:
                    flowerbed[i] = 1
                    count += 1
                    
        return count >= n
```
linear scanning, 
going pot by pot to see if both left & right positions are empty. If so, plant it down.
as long as there are more spaces than flowers to plant, it is valid.
