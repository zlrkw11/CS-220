# Bellman Ford Algorithm

## Dynamic programming strategy & single source shortest path

relax all edges n-1 times (n is no. of vertices)
if there are 7 vertices, we can maximally have 6 edges from any vertex

give the shortest path from 1 node to any other node in the graph.
Bellman Ford works on negative edge weights.
