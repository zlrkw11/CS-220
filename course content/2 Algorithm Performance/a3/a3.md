## Problem 1
### 1st For loop
this loop will run for n times no matter what. As i goes from 1-n, the *pseudo code assumes list index starts at 1 instead of 0.*

there will be n*C produced here

### 2nd For loop
in this case, how big s is depends on the number of **1**s inside the list **a**. I assume there will be 50% chance for each item in a to be either 1 or 0 as its randomly chosen. So, I assume s = 1/2*n. 

so, this loop should produce C*n/2 operations in total

### overall
these 2 loops are disjoint. So, the total C operations ran will just be adding together.

```n*C + n/2 * C = 3n/2 * C```
