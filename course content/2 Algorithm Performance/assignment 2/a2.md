## Problem 1

### Only calculate operations stated as C elementary operations

```
Function roticeol(n)ï¼š
    for i <- 1 to 2n do
        for j <- i to 3n do
            C elementary operations
```

1. start from inner loop
   the variable j that controls how many times the inner loop will run depends on variable i and input n.

   at the start
   i = 1, j = 1, n
   inner loop runs from j -> 3n which is 3n times.

## Problem 2

```
Function FindOne(a):
    For i <- 1 to n:
        if a[i] = 1:
            return i
    return 0
```

1. i goes from 0 to n
2. if array at index i is 1, return the index i
3. after all iterations from 1 to n, return 0
