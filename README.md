# Algorithms and data structures
I used to hate this course so much, had 0 mindset to do good in it. But I have realized how valuable it is and I refuse to be a loser who does not try his hardest against difficulties.

So, I made this learning repository for a more firm understanding on CS220. Includes course-related algorithms and notes as well as skills obtained on the internet by myself based on personal interest.
